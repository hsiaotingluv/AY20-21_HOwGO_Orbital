# HOwGO App

This is an navigation app developed as part of the NUS Orbital Programme (CP2106). 

## Description 

There are several navigation apps available for navigation around Singapore. In NUS, there are apps avaialble that shows what bus one should take to get to the nearest busstop at the destination. However, from the busstop there is no application that guides students on how to get to the classrooms. Our app closes this bridge by aiding the students to navigate around the faculties to find the specific classroom they are looking for. We believe that this will be useful for students on their first days to the classrooms for lesson and also during the examinations where they might not know where the various classrooms are.
